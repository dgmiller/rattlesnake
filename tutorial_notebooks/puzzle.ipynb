    " Suppose there are only two passengers and two seats. Then the first passenger chooses a seat randomly and you have a 1/2 chance of getting your seat. Suppose there are three passengers and three seats. Then there is a 1/3 chance that your seat is taken by the first passenger; if it is, then we have no chance of getting our own seat after the next passenger. But if the first passenger doesn't take our seat and instead chooses the next passenger's seat, then there is a 1/2 chance of getting our seat since the next passenger has to choose between our seat or the first passenger's seat. The third possibility is that the first passenger randomly chooses his own seat. This guarantees that we sit in our own seat. So our average of the three possibilities is (0+.5+1) / 3 = .5 or a 50% chance of getting our seat."
