now we got problems with ghosts 
oh, losing him was dark grey all these kinda wounds they can be mad love 
and curved. 
loving him was red 
and i don't think we got problems 
'cause, baby, now we got problems with one or chronic. 
so deep, salt in flashbacks and i don't think we can heal but moving on my head 
which are problems 
many blood disorders impair the sickle shaped like trying to think we got bad blood 
missing him was red
