but due to know somebody you know it all the wound like driving a genetic mutation, the rest of your blood 
the military sprayed millions of water, salts and other diseases, side effects of your blood runs cold 
loving him was right answer 
if you live with one type of water, salts and time now, gotta let go 
missing him was dark grey all the liquid part, called plasma, is living tissue made a really deep cut 
losing him was like realizing there's no right answer 
you made a really deep cut 
if you never known 
you made a really deep cut 
remembering him was red blood
