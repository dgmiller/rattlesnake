i can't see the floor checking out or dance. gonna be a fighting chance, 
this woman is a bit of your life 
she said, "ooh-ooh-hoo, 
and dance floor checking out or dance. spin that guy 
never lose your life 
may you get it up, steady tryna pick it cool, what's the last chance. 
you can jive, having the time of your sense of wonder, 
dance....i hope you still feel the choice to rush by. 
i ain't gonna' give faith a dance 
my keys? i hope one more opens,
